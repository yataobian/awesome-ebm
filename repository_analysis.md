## Critical Areas for Improvement

### 1. **Content Currency & Maintenance**

#### Issues:
- **2024-2025 sections marked as "@todo"** - major gap in recent literature
- Several recent important papers likely missing
- No clear update schedule or maintenance workflow

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Update 2024 section with major publications
- [ ] Add 2025 publications as they appear
- [ ] Establish quarterly update schedule
- [ ] Create issue templates for community contributions
- [ ] Add "Last Updated" timestamp to README
```

### 2. **Community Engagement & Contributions**

#### Issues:
- No contribution guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- No issue templates for suggesting papers
- Limited community involvement mechanism
- No clear criteria for paper inclusion

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**Priority: HIGH**
- [ ] Create CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
- [ ] Add paper suggestion issue template
- [ ] Define inclusion criteria (impact factor, venue requirements, etc.)
- [ ] Set up community review process for submissions
- [ ] Add contributor recognition system
```

### 3. **Organization & Discoverability**

#### Issues:
- No search functionality or tags
- Missing thematic categorization beyond chronology
- Limited cross-referencing between related papers
- No beginner-friendly entry points

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Add topic-based tags (e.g., #generation, #classification, #theory)
- [ ] Create thematic sections (Applications, Methods, Theory)
- [ ] Add difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- [ ] Implement paper relationship mapping
- [ ] Create reading roadmaps for different backgrounds
```

### 4. **Technical Infrastructure**

#### Issues:
- Basic Jekyll setup with minimal styling
- No automated link checking
- No citation format validation
- Missing dependency management for potential tools

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Implement automated link checking (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Add citation format validation
- [ ] Enhanced Jekyll theme with better navigation
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design improvements
- [ ] Add search functionality
```

### 5. **Content Quality & Standardization**

#### Issues:
- Inconsistent citation formatting across years
- Some missing abstracts or descriptions
- Limited code availability information
- Broken or outdated links (especially older papers)

#### Recommendations:
```markdown
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- [ ] Standardize citation format throughout
- [ ] Add one-line descriptions for each paper
- [ ] Verify and update all external links
- [ ] Add code availability badges/indicators
- [ ] Include paper impact metrics where relevant
```
